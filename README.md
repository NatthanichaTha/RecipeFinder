# RecipeFinder
A FastAPI-based backend that provides endpoints for fetching and filtering recipes from a database with over 200k+ recipes! It allows users to retrieve random recipes, search recipes by ingredients, and search recipes by name.

## Features
- **Get Random Recipe:** Retrieve a random recipe with an optional filter for maximum preparation time.
- **Get Recipes by Ingredients:** Search for recipes based on a list of ingredients, with optional filters for the number of ingredients and maximum preparation time.
- **Get Recipes by Name:** Search for recipes based on a partial match of the recipe name, with pagination support.
